This was a project which my team made during internship at IIT-Mandi, in Jan-2024.
Basically we had developed a simple 4-wheeled rover with camera on it, which we can control it using our keyboard, and can see the real-time simulation on Gazebo.

HOW TO RUN:
This bascially runs on Ubuntu, using ROS nodes on Gazebo, I will be attaching a screenrecording how to run it.
